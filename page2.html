                The company that became Alfa Romeo was founded as Società Anonima Italiana Darracq (SAID) in 1906 by
                the French automobile firm of Alexandre Darracq, with some Italian investors. One of them, Cavaliere Ugo Stella,
                an aristocrat from Milan, became chairman of the SAID in 1909.[5] The firm's initial location was in Naples,
                but even before the construction of the planned factory had started, Darracq decided late in 1906 that Milan
                would be more suitable and accordingly a tract of land was acquired in the Milan suburb of Portello,
                where a new factory of 6,700 square metres (8,000 sq yd) was erected. Late 1909, the Italian Darracq
                cars were selling slowly and Stella, with the other Italian co-investors, founded a new company named A.L.F.A. (Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili),
                initially still in partnership with Darracq. The first non-Darracq car produced by the company was the 1910 24 HP, designed by Giuseppe Merosi,
                hired in 1909 for designing new cars more suited to the Italian market. Merosi would go on to design a series of new A.L.F.A. cars,
                with more powerful engines (40–60 HP). A.L.F.A. ventured into motor racing, with drivers Franchini and Ronzoni competing in the 1911 Targa Florio with two 24-hp models.

                <p style="word-break:break-all, "> The Spider was launched at the 36th Geneva Motor Show in March 1966, and together with the Giulia Sprint GT Veloce
                    tested by the press at an event organised in Gardone Riviera. To choose a name for the spider Alfa Romeo announced a write-in competition,
                    offering an example of the new car as a prize. Over 100 thousand ballots were sent in, the great majority from Italy; the winner was Guidobaldo Trionfi,
                    a man from Brescia, who proposed the name "Duetto" (duet). However it could not be officially adopted due to trademark issues,
                    and the car was named simply Alfa Romeo Spider 1600. The Spider's 1,570 cc twin cam engine had dual Weber two-barrel side-draft carburetors,
                    and produced 109 PS DIN (80 kW; 108 hp; or 129 PS SAE). Sparsely fitted inside but including five speed manual transmission,
                    disc brakes 15" wheels fitted with Pirelli Cinturato 155HR15 CA67 tyres. The price on launch in Italy was 2,195,000 lire.
                    In the US the car sold for $3,950 (compared to $3,991 for a Lotus Elan and $2,607 for an MGB). In the UK the car's price was close to a Jaguar E-Type.</p>
