                Manufacturing magnate Italian Ferruccio Lamborghini founded the company in 1963 with the objective of producing a refined grand touring car to compete
                with offerings from established marques such as Ferrari. The company's first models, such as the 350 GT, were released in the mid-1960s and were noted
                for their refinement, power and comfort. Lamborghini gained wide acclaim in 1966 for the Miura sports coupe, which established rear mid-engine,
                rear wheel drive as the standard layout for high-performance cars of the era.

                Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first ten years, but sales plunged in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis.
                Ferruccio Lamborghini sold ownership of the company to Georges-Henri Rossetti and Rene Leimer and retired in 1974. The company went bankrupt in 1978,
                and was placed in the receivership of brothers Jean-Claude and Patrick Mimran in 1980. The Mimrans purchased the company out of receivership by 1984
                and invested heavily in the company's expansion. Under the Mimrans' management,
                Lamborghini's model line was expanded from the Countach to include the Jalpa sports car and the LM002 high performance off-road vehicle.

                The Lamborghini About this soundCountach is a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive sports car produced
                by the Italian automobile manufacturer Lamborghini from 1974 to 1990.
                It is one of the then-exotic designs conceptualized by Italian Design house Bertone, which pioneered and popularized the sharply angled "Italian Wedge" design language.
                This design language was originally embodied and introduced to the public in 1970 as the Lancia Stratos Zero concept car.
                The first showing of the Countach prototype was at the 1971 Geneva Motor Show, as the Lamborghini LP500 concept car.
                The Countach also popularized the "cab forward" design concept, which pushes the passenger compartment forward to accommodate a larger rear-mounted engine.
                The development of the Lamborghini Countach was initiated by Ferruccio Lamborghini with the goal of creating a successor to the Lamborghini Miura.
                The Miura was widely acclaimed after its introduction in 1966, but by 1970 new competitors including the Ferrari Daytona had been released,
                and the Miura was showing its age. Chief engineer Paolo Stanzani and his staff began work on the Miura successor in 1970 under the project name "LP112."
                From the beginning of the project, Stanzani's collaborators included test driver Bob Wallace, assistant engineer Massimo Parenti and designer Marcello Gandini of Bertone.
                Stanzani and Mr. Lamborghini agreed that the Miura's successor required a mechanical design that enabled the greatest possible performance
                as well as a body that was both aerodynamically efficient and aesthetically daring. These principles had informed the Miura's development
                and enabled the commercial success of that model. Despite Mr. Lamborghini's preference for comfortable grand tourers, he recognized the commercial value of
                a more uncompromising sports car like the Miura and gave Stanzani's team permission to further push boundaries with the LP112 project.
                The resulting Countach incorporated successful aspects of the Miura, such as the rear mid-engine, rear wheel drive layout along with many new engineering and styling innovations.
                Lamborghini's engineering team addressed several flaws in the Miura design, improving high-speed stability and reducing lift-off oversteer as well as
                addressing the limited maintenance access, uneven weight distribution and cooling issues endemic to the Miura's transverse engine layout.
