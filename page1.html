                The Lancia Delta is a small family car produced by Italian automobile manufacturer Lancia in three generations.
                The first generation produced between 1979 and 1994, the second generation from 1993 to 1999, and the third generation from 2008 to 2014.
                The Delta was first shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 1979. The Delta dominated the World Rally Championship during the late 1980s and early 1990s.
                The homologation requirements of Group A regulations meant marketing road-going versions of these competition cars — the Lancia Delta HF 4WD and
                HF Integrale. A total of 44,296 Integrales were produced
                The car that would become the Delta during its development went by the project codename Y 5, was conceived as an upmarket front-wheel drive
                small family car positioned below the larger Beta; an offering around four meters in length had been absent from Lancia's lineup since the demise of the Fulvia Berlina in 1973.

                <p style="word-break:break-all, ">The Delta HF 4WD was unveiled at the April 1986 Turin Motor Show,[30] becoming the top of the Delta range. The HF 4WD's 1,995 cc, twin-cam, 8-valve engine with two counter-rotating balancing shafts was derived from the Lancia Thema i.e. turbo saloon. It was equipped with a Garrett turbocharger, a wastegate valve, an air-to-air intercooler and Weber IAW integrated electronic ignition and fuel injection; to support turbocharging it also adopted tri-metallic crankpin and main bearings, sodium-filled valves, bronze valve guides and an oil cooler.[31][29] Engine output was 165 PS (121 kW; 163 hp) at 5,250 rpm, and 26.5 kg⋅m (260 N⋅m; 192 lb⋅ft) of torque at 2,750 rpm, that could rise to 29 kg⋅m (284 N⋅m; 210 lb⋅ft) for short periods of time thanks to an overboost function.[29] On the Delta HF 4WD the torque split ratio of the central epicyclic differential stood at 56/44 front to rear.</p>
