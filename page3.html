                On 11 July 1899, Giovanni Agnelli was part of the group of founding members of FIAT, Fabbrica Italiana di Automobili Torino.
                The first Fiat plant opened in 1900 with 35 staff making 24 cars. Known from the beginning for the talent and creativity of its engineering staff,
                by 1903 Fiat made a small profit and produced 135 cars; this grew to 1,149 cars by 1906. The company then went public selling shares via the Milan stock exchange.
                Agnelli led the company until his death in 1945, while Vittorio Valletta administered the firm's daily activities. Its first car, the 3½ CV
                (of which only 24 copies were built, all bodied by Alessio of Turin) was based on a design purchased from Ceirano GB & C and had a 697 cc
                (42.5 cu in) boxer twin engine. In 1903, Fiat produced its first truck. In 1908, the first Fiat was exported to the US.
                That same year, the first Fiat aircraft engine was produced. Also around the same time, Fiat taxis became popular in Europe.
                By 1910, Fiat was the largest automotive company in Italy. That same year, a new plant was built in Poughkeepsie, NY,
                by the newly founded American F.I.A.T. Automobile Company. Owning a Fiat at that time was a sign of distinction.
                The cost of a Fiat in the US was initially $4,000 and rose up to $6,400 in 1918, compared to $825 for a Ford Model T in 1908,
                and $525 in 1918, respectively. During World War I, Fiat had to devote all of its factories to supplying the Allies with aircraft,
                engines, machine guns, trucks, and ambulances. Upon the entry of the US into the war in 1917, the factory was shut down
                as US regulations became too burdensome. After the war, Fiat introduced its first tractor, the 702. By the early 1920s, Fiat had a market share in Italy of 80%.

                <p style="word-break:break-all, "> The Fiat Dino was introduced as a 2-seater Spider at the Turin Motor Show in October 1966;
                 a 2+2 Coupe version, built on a 270 mm (10.6 in) longer wheelbase, bowed a few months later at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1967.
                 The two bodies showed very different lines, as they had been designed and were manufactured for Fiat by two different coachbuilders:
                 the Spider by Pininfarina, and the Coupe by Bertone—where it had been sketched out by Giorgetto Giugiaro.
                 Curiously the Spider type approval identified it as a 2+1 seater. The Spider had poorer interior trim than the Coupe,
                 below par for its class: the dashboard was covered in vinyl, the metal-spoke steering wheel had a plastic rim,
                 and the interior switchgear was derived from cheaper Fiat models. After a few months this issue was addressed,
                 and Spiders produced after February 1967 had a wood-rimmed steering wheel as well as a wood trim on the dashboard
                 like the sister Coupe car had since the beginning. Option lists for both models were limited to radio, metallic paint,
                 leather upholstery, and for the Spider a vinyl-covered hardtop with roll-bar style stainless steel trim.
                 The car was offered with an all-aluminium DOHC 2.0 L V6, coupled to a 5-speed manual transmission.
                 The same 2.0-litre engine was used in mid-engined, Ferrari-built Dino 206 GT, which was introduced in pre-production form at
                 the 1967 Turin Motor Show and went on sale in 1968. Fiat quoted 160 PS (118 kW; 158 hp) for the Fiat Dino,
                 while in 1967 Ferrari—presenting the first prototype of the Dino 206 GT—claimed 180 hp (130 kW) despite
                 both engines were made by Fiat workers in Turin on the same production line, without any discrimination as to their destination.
                 Jean-Pierre Gabriel in "Les Ferraris de Turin" notes that, "La declaration de Ferrari ne reposait sur aucun fondament technique"—Ferrari's
                 statement had no technical basis. The real reason for this difference was a mistake in between quotes made in SAE and BHP power output.</p>
